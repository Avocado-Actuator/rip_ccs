# UART Prototyping

Due to a late change from RS485 to UART communication initial testing/prototyping of the new protocol (on both the `brain` and `avocado` end) was done in this separate repo. See the [`brain`](https://github.com/Avocado-Actuator/uart_prototyping/tree/brain) branch for commit history on the controller communication software library. See the [`avocado`](https://github.com/Avocado-Actuator/uart_prototyping/tree/avocado) branch for commit history on the communication firmware of the avocado.
